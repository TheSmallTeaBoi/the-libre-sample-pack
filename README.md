# **The Libre Sample Pack**
##### *A free (as in free beer and free speech) sample pack*
---
## **What is this?**

It is a free (as in freedom) and collaborative sample and preset pack, a bit more intended for Linux musicians, since all presets will be for Linux plugins.
(not exclusively for linux musicians or hosts of course!)

### **Why?**

Because freedom is cool. Also because FOSS music production is a bit bare in resources and it would be nice to change that.

### **By who?**

By Linux musicians / FOSS enthusiasts, for everyone.
